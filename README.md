# SQLITE-for-CMS

From <a href="mailto:dave@vsoft-software.com">Dave Jones</a>:
 ## 
SQLite  is a relational database management system (RDBMS) contained in
 a C-language user library. In contrast to many other database management
 systems, SQLite is not a clientserver database engine. Rather, it is
 embedded into the end program.
 
 SQLite is ACID-compliant and implements most of the SQL standard, generally
 following PostgreSQL syntax.
 
SQLite is a popular choice as embedded database software for local/client
 storage in application software such as web browsers. It is arguably the
 most widely deployed database engine, as it is used today by several
 widespread browsers, operating systems, and embedded systems (such as
 mobile phones), among others. SQLite has bindings to many programming
 languages.

This is a port of the most recent verion of SQLITE3, 33.0, dated
 2020-08-14, the the CMS environment of z/VM 7.1, using the z/VM C/C++
 Version 1.3 compiler.
 
Complete documentation on how to use the library can be found at the:
